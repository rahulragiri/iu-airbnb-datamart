Installation Instruction

1.Pre-requisite:
This database requires MySQL Workbench. Download and install it from the official website based on your operating system: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/


2.Connecting to your Database:

Launch MySQL Workbench and navigate to the Connections section (usually on the left side).
Click the plus sign (+) button to create a new connection.
Fill in your connection details (hostname, username, password).
Choose a clear name for the connection (e.g., "My Airbnb Project").
Verify the information by clicking "Test Connection". If successful, click "OK" to save.



3.Downloading and Setting Up the Project

Navigate to the project's repository on GitHub: https://github.com/rahulragiri/iu-airbnb-datamart.git
Download the project files as a ZIP archive (Code > Download ZIP).
Extract the downloaded ZIP and navigate to the Finalization directory.
Locate the airbnb_schema.sql file. Execute this file to create the Airbnb database schema in your MySQL environment (instructions might vary depending on your MySQL Workbench setup).
After creating the schema, follow the same process to execute the airbnb_triggers.sql and airbnb_get_total_booking_price_function.sql files. These establish triggers and functions for your database.
Once you've completed these steps, your Airbnb database setup is complete!
